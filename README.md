## Background
This project is a workthrough of various tutorials to get basic elements of Google Analytics to work with a simple Create-React-App webapp.

## Key Objectives
* Basic page level tracking for Google analytics products:
  * Global Analytics
  * Google Analytics 4
* Ability to work on Chrome, Firefox and Edge
* User consent required to iniate

## Key Links
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Analytics enablement from [this blog post](https://dev.to/ramonak/react-enable-google-analytics-after-a-user-grants-consent-5bg3) by Kate Lupachova
* Better implemenation by react-ga community [juliaqiuxy](https://github.com/juliaqiuxy) with the component [React-Router-v4-withTracker](https://github.com/react-ga/react-ga/wiki/React-Router-v4-withTracker) 
* Bundle Size Explorer from [Facebook](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size/)
* [React Cookie Consent](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm deploy`

Runs the app build script and deploys to gh-pages

### `npm analyze` 

Runs an analysis on the bundle size.
Always run the build script first.
